Refactoring means changing the code to make it better without changing it's behavior.
It makes our messy code look clean code, easy to maintain, understand and scale.
## Clean Code ## 
1. It is easily understandable for other programmers.
   * By this I means, choosing appropriate names of variables, functions, classes etc.
   * Keep functions sort and easy.
   * Doing only one task  per function.
2. It is easy to maintain and scale.
3. It does not contain duplicate codes.
4. Always try to write less code, because the lesser the code, the easier it is to maintain it.
   * By this I mean, Writing minimal number of classes etc.
5. Our code should pass all test cases(Unit test, Integration test etc.) 

## When to Refactor ## 
 * ### Rule of Three ###
    1. When you’re doing something for the first time, just get it done.
    2. When you’re doing something similar for the second time, cringe at having to repeat but do the same thing anyway.
    3. When you’re doing something for the third time, start refactoring.
* When you have to deal with someone's dirty code, understand it and then try to refactor it to make it cleaner and easy to understand because it will not only help you but also the developers who are going to use it after you.
* The cleaner the code, the lesser will be the bugs and hence you make your managers happy.
* Code review is the last and best step to find all bugs in the code and refactor them but at the same time it takes lots of time and can be very hectic. 

## How to Refactor ## 
* The code should become cleaner.
* New functionality should not be created at the time of refactoring.
* All the existing test cases should pass after refactoring.
